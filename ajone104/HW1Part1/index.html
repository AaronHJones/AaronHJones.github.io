  <h1>Aaron Jones</h1>
  <p>I have a beautiful <b><em>daughter</em></b> and a beautiful <b><em>wife</em></b>. This is my <b><em>junior</em></b> year.
    I am right on the cusp of my 4th year and <b><em>final</em></b> couple of semesters.</p>
  <h2>Classes I'm taking this semester</h2>
  <h3>Session A</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="classes">SER 315: Software Enterprise - Design and Process</li>
    <li class="classes">IFT 360: Applications in Artificial Intelligence</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Session B</h3>
  <ul>
    <li class="classes">SER 316: Software Enterprise II - Construction and Transition</li>
    <li class="classes">IFT 301: Web Programming for Human Computer Interface</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My three favorite movies/books/shows</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>I enjoyed reading Stephen King's <a href="https://stephenking.com/darktower/" target="_blank"><i>The Dark Tower Series</i></a></li>
    <li>I thought "Utopia" on Amazon was pretty good. I think they took it down after covid hit. Too close to home I guess.</li>
    <li>My favorite movie is <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Goals for the semester</h2>
  <h3>My ultimate goal for school is to graduate with honors.</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>SER 315</dt>
    <dd>
      My goal for SER 315 was to complete the course with an A or A+. I made an A-. While an A- is not as good, I am happy
      with the progress I made.
    </dd>
    <dt>IFT 360</dt>
    <dd>
      This class was a mixed bag for me. I did not know what to expect going into a class teaching AI.
      I wasn't wild about the class not having lectures (or any real teaching material), but I learned a lot more than I
      thought I would.</dd>
    <dt>SER 316</dt>
    <dd>
      I think my main goal for this session is to develop a better life/school/work balance. I often get frustrated with
      the amount of time it takes me to work through a week's material.
      So, I plan on working hard in a more structured way. Of course, I want to make an A as well.
    </dd>
    <dt>IFT 301</dt>
    <dd>
      This is also one of those classes where I do not really know what to expect. I've worked with a few web app frameworks
      and html. I have not, however, had much experience with javascript.
      My goal for this class then is to get a good grab on coding with javascript or typescript.

  <h2>Interesting things about my life...</h2>
  <p>
    I have a daughter who will turn eight in June. She's good at math. Daddy is so proud! She and I like to play video<br>
    games together<br>
    I've been married to my beautiful wife for almost 14 years. We met when we were really young. Maybe 7 or 8. We<br>
    didn't really hang out in the same crowds. I started playing guitar at a different church when I was about sixteen,<br>
    but fate brought us back together. We live in Buda, TX. Just south of Austin. I've been working for the state since<br>
    we moved to the Austin area. I like serving with the state, but I'm finishing up my degree and hope to make more<br>
    money in a new (more lucrative) career field.
