        </li>
        <li class="booksMovies">I thought "Utopia" on Amazon was pretty good. I think they took it down after covid hit. Too close to home I guess.</li>
        <li class="booksMovies">My favorite movie is <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>.</li>

    <h2>Goals for the semester</h2>
    <h3>My ultimate goal for school is to graduate with honors.</h3>
    <ul class="classGoals">
        <li><h2>SER 315</h2>
                <p class="classGoals">
                    My goal for SER 315 was to complete the course with an A or A+. I made an A-. While an A- is not as good, I am happy
                    with the progress I made.
                </p>
        </li>
        <li><h2>IFT 360</h2>
        <p class="classGoals">
            This class was a mixed bag for me. I did not know what to expect going into a class teaching AI.
            I wasn't wild about the class not having lectures (or any real teaching material), but I learned a lot more than I
            thought I would.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h2>SER 316</h2>
        <p class="classGoals">
            I think my main goal for this session is to develop a better life/school/work balance. I often get frustrated with
            the amount of time it takes me to work through a week's material.
            So, I plan on working hard in a more structured way. Of course, I want to make an A as well.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><h2>IFT 301</h2>
        <p class="classGoals">
            This is also one of those classes where I do not really know what to expect. I've worked with a few web app frameworks
            and html. I have not, however, had much experience with javascript.
            My goal for this class then is to get a good grab on coding with javascript or typescript.
